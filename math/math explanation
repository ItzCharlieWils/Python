The math module in Python is a built-in library that provides access to mathematical functions and constants
It's used for various calculations, including trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential computations. 
The key aspect of the math module:
  Importing:
The module is imported using import math.  

    Constants:
It includes constants like math.pi, and math.e (Euler's number). 

    Functions:
It offers a wide array of functions for different mathematical operations: 
Trigonometric: sin(), cos(), tan(), etc. 
Logarithmic: log(), log10(), etc. 
Exponential: exp(), sqrt(), etc. 
Rounding: ceil(), floor(), trunc(). 
Other: factorial(), gcd(), isqrt(), comb(), etc. 

    Usage:
To use a function, you call it with the module name as a prefix: math.sqrt(25). 
The math module is essential for mathematical computations in Python.
And it's a tool for calculating scientific and engineering tasks.
